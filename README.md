I'm a programmer who lives in Wellington Aotearoa. At the moment my main language is C but I also do some stuff in other languages.

## What I'm working on

- Blink - Blink is my main individual project. It's a poorly made transit app for Wellington City.
- OIL -  OIL is a programming language made in c.
